WEEK 1 tasks completed.
WEEK 3 tasks completed.
Till now i have learned basic gpu ray tracing, able to generate ppm files involving one or more spheres of different colors given by or calculated by various parameters, some new concepts i learnt worth mentioning are :
Move Semantics and Smart Pointers:
 a.Introduction to smart pointers and move semantics
 b.R-value references
 c.Move constructors and move assignment
 d.std::move
 e.std::unique_ptr
 f.std::shared_ptr
Virtual Functions:
 a.Pointers and references to the base class of derived objects
 b.Virtual functions and polymorphism
 c.The override and final specifiers, and covariant return types
 d.Virtual destructors, virtual assignment, and overriding virtualization
 e.Early binding and late binding
 f.etc
Also i have learnt basic sycl , through which i am able optimize the process of the generation of the ppm file.
Thos is the link to the GitHub repository on which we are given tasks and i have completed all tasks upto now: https://github.com/KeyaanKR/SOC25-GPU-based-Ray-Tracer
